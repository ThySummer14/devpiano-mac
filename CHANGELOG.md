## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **默认 UI 语言跟随系统语言**（`SettingsModel::defaultUiLanguageCode()`）— 首次启动按 `juce::SystemStats::getDisplayLanguage()` 自动选择简体中文/英文；设置窗口「Language:」下拉框仍可随时切换并持久化。设置界面切换能力沿用上游运行时 i18n（内嵌 `zh_CN.loc` + JUCE `LocalisedStrings`）。
- **zh_CN 语言包补全 5 条缺失词条** — 对照源码全部 `TRANS()` 字符串（168 条）查漏：「无音频设备」「移调：开」与预设保存/删除/重命名状态栏提示，实现语言包 100% 覆盖。

### Added

- **macOS (Apple Silicon) 原生支持** — 全量源码在 macOS/arm64 + Apple Clang 下编译通过并实测运行，CoreAudio 输出与 VST3 插件扫描均正常：
  - 新增 `macos-clang-release` / `macos-clang-debug` CMake Preset（`CMakePresets.json`）；
  - 新增 `scripts/build_macos.sh` 一键环境自检 + 配置 + 构建 + 启动脚本；
  - README 新增「macOS 快速开始」章节（环境要求、子模块还原、键位表、移植说明）。

### Changed

- **JUCE 子模块固定至 8.0.15**（`.gitmodules`）— JIVE 声明式 UI 框架尚未适配 JUCE 9（`Drawable` 不再继承 `Component`，`setTransformToFit`/`createFromSVG` API 变更），升 9 需先移植 JIVE。
- **APPLE 平台跳过预编译头**（`CMakeLists.txt`）— CMake PCH 以纯 C++ 语言模式生成，套用到 JUCE 的 `.mm`（Objective-C++）翻译单元会报 "Objective-C was disabled in precompiled file"；Windows/Linux 无 `.mm` 翻译单元，PCH 行为不变。

### Added

- **PR-Agent AI 代码审查工作流**（`.github/workflows/pr-agent.yml` + `.pr_agent.toml`）— 基于 DeepSeek v4 Flash 的自动 PR 审查：PR 打开/更新时自动生成描述与代码审查，支持 PR 内 `/review` `/describe` `/improve` `/ask` 手动命令。
- **PR-Agent 使用指南**（`docs/guides/pr-agent.md`）— 记录工作流触发方式、配置项、手动命令与故障排查。

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-23

Official v1.0.0 milestone release of devpiano — modern computer keyboard piano application featuring high-fidelity physical modeling piano synthesis, VST3 instrument hosting, full 88-key grand piano keybed with wide-window dynamic centering, 16-channel MIDI key signature & transposition pipeline, JIVE declarative UI modernization, and robust multi-track performance recording & playback.

### Added

- **Standard 88-Key Grand Piano Range (A0–C8 / MIDI 21–108)** — full 88-key piano keyboard layout mapping seamlessly across physical keyboard, virtual keyboard mouse interaction, and MIDI file playback.
- **Wide-Window Dynamic Centering** (`CustomKeyboard`) — mathematical symmetrical centering for 88-key piano bed on wide screens and maximized windows with preserved 100% viewport vertical height fill ($170\text{ px}$) and full viewport felt strip rendering.
- **Real-Time 3-Column Status Bar** (`MainComponent`) — active display showing live MIDI activity indicator, active plugin/preset name, audio engine metrics (sample rate, buffer size, latency, CPU usage), and active key signature/layout mode.
- **Virtual Keyboard Dirty Rectangle Optimization** — fast-path clipped dirty rectangle repainting (`repaintKey()`) eliminating UI lag during virtuosic piano playback.
- **Performance Preset Overwrite Confirmation Dialog** (`PresetConfirmDialog`) — safeguards user preset library against unintended file overwrites.
- **Enhanced Modal Piano Synthesizer v3** (`PianoSynthVoice`) — coupled-form recursive oscillators, stiff-string inharmonicity across 4 register zones, soundboard modal resonator bank, and two-stage decay envelope.
- **16-Channel Follow Key Transposition Matrix** — real-time transposition engine with GM Channel 10 percussion bypass.

### Changed

- Default keyboard layout converged to standard 88-key grand piano range (MIDI 21 to 108).
- LookAndFeel ComboBox outlines aligned with `cardBorder` to eliminate 4-corner highlight artifacts.
- PopupMenu checkmarks right-aligned with proper label margins to prevent text clipping.
- Text input editors (`PathEditor`, `ListEditor`, `MetadataEditor`) across modal dialogs granted explicit focusability and standard text cursors.
- Button row heights adjusted to eliminate rounded corner clipping on preset and setting cards.

### Fixed

- Virtual keyboard height clipping fixed, ensuring 100% vertical viewport fill without shrinking.
- App title "devpiano" 'p' descender clipping in window header resolved.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-20

Enhanced physical modeling piano synthesizer (Enhanced Modal Piano v3), real-time global key signature and playback transposition pipeline, virtual keyboard dirty rectangle optimization, preset overwrite confirmation, 16-channel routing matrix, dual tone engine switching, and comprehensive UI/visual polish.

### Added

- **Enhanced Modal Piano Synthesizer v3** (`PianoSynthVoice`) — a high-fidelity physical modeling modal synthesizer as the default fallback instrument without external plugins.
  - **Magic Circle coupled-form recursive oscillators** — zero per-sample `std::sin()` calls with strict amplitude bounds and exact frequency tracking.
  - **Stiff-string inharmonicity modeling** ($f_m = m \cdot f_0 \cdot \sqrt{1 + B \cdot m^2}$) across 4 distinct keyboard acoustic regions.
  - **Two-stage modal decay envelope** (fast strike radiation vs long-tailed polarization tail) with high-frequency modal damping slopes.
  - **Triple-string unison beating doublet** with microscopic detuning ($0.10\%\sim 0.20\%$) on bass/midrange partials.
  - **Soundboard modal resonator bank** (8 resonant modal poles from $75\text{ Hz}$ to $950\text{ Hz}$) with wet/dry body coupling.
  - **Dual-mapping velocity response** ($v^{1.5}$ loudness curve + progressive high-frequency strike brightness).
- **Real-time Global Key Signature & Transposition Pipeline** — seamless real-time pitch shifting across live keyboard playing, virtual piano mouse clicks, and imported multi-track MIDI file playback with full $[0, 127]$ safe clamping.
- **General MIDI (GM) Channel 10 Percussion Bypass** — hardware-workstation-grade drum channel protection ensuring rhythm kits remain completely unshifted during transposition.
- **16-Channel Follow Key Matrix Unification** — independent per-channel transpose masks allowing fine-grained control over which MIDI channels follow global key signature changes.
- **Virtual Keyboard Dirty Rectangle Repainting** (`CustomKeyboard`) — localized `repaintKey()` and `clip.intersects()` bounding box checks eliminating full-component redraw overhead during high-speed playback and chord play.
- **Performance Preset Overwrite Confirmation** (`PresetConfirmDialog`) — safeguards user preset files from accidental overwrites during rename or save operations.
- **Dual built-in tone switching** — seamless switching between Physical Piano and Sine synth fallbacks via UI dropdown, CLI flags (`--piano`, `--sine`), and persisted configuration.
- **4x4 symmetrical controls panel layout** — redesigned ControlsPanel with an upper Piano tone row (Volume, Brightness, Hammer, Resonance) and a lower ADSR envelope row (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release).
- **Offline WAV export tone fidelity** — WAV export options propagate built-in tone selection and physical piano parameters to offline rendering.
- **Expanded deterministic test suite** (`PianoSynthVoiceTest`, `AudioEnginePlaybackTransposeTest`, `MidiChannelMapperTest`) — comprehensive unit tests covering partial frequencies, inharmonicity, decay slopes, playback transposition, and channel 10 bypass.

### Changed

- ComboBox outline color mapped to `cardBorder` to eliminate 4-corner highlight artifacts.
- PopupMenu checkmarks moved to the right edge with aligned label padding to prevent text overlap.

### Fixed

- Text input editors (`PathEditor`, `ListEditor`, `MetadataEditor`) in JIVE modal dialogs and panels now properly grab focus and respond to keyboard input.
- File button row rounded corner clipping in preset card resolved.
- App title "devpiano" 'p' descender clipping in window header resolved by expanding line height.
